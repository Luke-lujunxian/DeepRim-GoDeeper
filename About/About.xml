--- Original Description ---
Allows construction of mining shaft, which can drill down and bring you new maps to explore and mine for resource.  
Never run out of ores! 
Avoid the lazy Deep drill with this new revolutionary mining method!

- Start by building a mining shaft and click start. It requires power while drilling. (It's not magic, duh)
- Once finished, you get the option to send people and item down
- They'll end up in the underground map, full of rocks and ores to mine.

FAQ:
Will there be raids in the underground?
Unlikely. I can't say for sure. Raids can probably still be forced for underground, but it'll probably just spew some red errors. Can't say what will happen, since there's quite a number of storyteller, and some are custom.

Will this mod works with [X]?
Most likely. If there's any incompatibility issue, please tell me.

Will [Custom Ore of some mod] spawn underground?
If it spawns above ground, it will likely spawn underground (Assuming that the mod configured them correctly, instead of writing a code to spawn spawn ore after your pawns landed) . At the moment, it is confirmed that hardcore SK's ores spawn correctly underground.

LAG! LAG! LAG! It's lagging!
That's not a question. But yes, this mod will take more CPU when drilling a new layer, specifically, when the drilling is done, and a new layer is generated. It only last a moment though, after that, you should be fine. There's no solution for this at the moment, unless Rimworld somehow does multi-threading. Having too many layer will also cause lag. Try to avoid that.

How do I move item from one layer to another?
Put a stockpile zone on the lift, move whatever item you wish to move. Use the bring up/move down feature to move the items. (Items, pawns, and animals are all moved by the lift in the same way)

Planned Feature:
Multiple shaft to single map, allowing tunnels to be made
Balancing
Deeper layers will have different map generation method. For example, lava and hotter in deeper layer.

Author/Mod Team
Me. Just me. I think, for now.
Oh, wait. Asset by jabbamonkey is used.
